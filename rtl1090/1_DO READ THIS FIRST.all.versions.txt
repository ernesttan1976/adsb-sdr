A complete description is available from the OPERATING MANUAL at
http://rtl1090.jetvision.de  - Select RTL1090 manual from the side bar

rtl1090 (Updated for Build 100)
=======

Non tunable 1090 MHz receiver for Mode-A/C or Mode-S
Mode-AC and Mode-S cannot be output at the same time

Required:
E4000* or R820T and RTL2832U USB DVB-T Dongle

*ATTENTION: not all these devices cover 1090 MHz. You can explore the
edges of your devices frequency coverage by using the MAX/MIN button after the
device was started.

IF YOU HAVE RUN SDRSHARP or a similar software with your USB dongle successfully before,
you can skip the "Zadig" installation instruction!

Installation (not good for upgrade to a newer build)
============
- Download the latest "Zadig" installation package from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libwdi/files/zadig/
WIN XP-users >>> select the package named "_XP_"

- Plug-in your USB-TV-Stick, ignore and abort driver installation messages

- Execute "zadig.exe"

- Install the WinUSB driver and the driver for "Bulk-In Interface 0"
(A more comprehensive list of installation instructions is here:
http://rtlsdr.org/softwarewindows )
The installation is only valid for one specific USB slot.
If you use another slot later you must repeat the installation.

- Download and unzip the application files to a directory of your
choice

- Download this file
http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/rtl-sdr/RelWithDebInfo.zip
and unzip and copy rtl-sdr-release\x32\rtlsdr.dll, msvcr100.dll and libusb-1.0.dll
to your application folder

ATTENTION: temporary unavailability of this file:
Please read FAQ from http://rtl1090.jetvision.de if you cannot find this file

The following files should be in your folder now:

rtl1090.exe
libusb-1.0.dll
msvcr100.dll
rtlsdr.dll

Now execute rtl1090.exe.

The application opens a TCP server on port 31001 (for the first dongle) and this will be
queried by the Windows Firewall. To run rtl1090 together with
Planeplotter this needs to be acknowledged.

For a quick start select RTL AGC and TUNER AGC.
This is the best setting for best range.
If you encounter doughnut problems from nearby targets, then switch
off TUNER AGC and select a high (if not the highest) gain value.

Thats all.

<0x1a> <"1">  6 byte MLAT, 1 byte signal level, 2 byte Mode-AC
<0x1a> <"2">  6 byte MLAT, 1 byte signal level, 7 byte Mode-S short frame
<0x1a> <"3">  6 byte MLAT, 1 byte signal level, 14 byte Mode-S long frame
<0x1a><0x1a>  true 0x1a

MLAT: the counter has a resolution of 500 ns for Mode-S and 488 ns for Mode A/C

Signal level: 0..255
